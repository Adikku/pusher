#Pusher
####A push navigation with a sideorder of more push

There may come a time when you actually need to have a navigation strategy like this one. Pusher is two push navigations that work independently an enables a more complex navigation system. It's built on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) so you'd need to have this installed.

Pusher uses [Fontello](http://fontello.com/) icons so it's easy to change or add custom icons.

__Usage__
Place a link to the css inside the <head> tag in your index file (make sure you remember Bootstrap).

```
<head>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/pusher-left.css">
</head>
```

Pusher makes use of a few classes that wrap the navigation and content, so make sure you have them in place. Easiest is to check out the source code or git to get the markup structure and jQuery class-toggle snippet

Pusher comes pre-compiled for both left and right positioning but if you prefer (like I do) all the LESS files are available as well.
